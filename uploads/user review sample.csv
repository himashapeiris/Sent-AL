im so happy for choosing this dialog wifi router 
"Dialog Broadband has been brilliant in the Highlands, they are far more stable an internet provider than my previous provider"
"If you want a company who gives you a honest price, and no hidden extras then Network Telecom is your company."
dialoglk i was told my problem would be sorted in 54 hours. Been a week now. Unbelievable. Ridiculous. #dialoglk #USELESS #crap
conveniant customer care
"Yesterday evening I have mailed regarding the issue to your area manager, he dropped me a message saying he received the mail and he will forward it to the relevant department and take a decision and contact me.."
"came to Dialog at Gampaha to get a new broadband connection, waiting for 30min in the queue"
"Dear Dialog, u maybe big but tis is not how u treat a customer. It more than two weeks, has the agent assigned this is in MARS. ny body who knws Dialog executives pls tag. Customer complaints shud  be handle respectfully. Disgraceful service. #dialoglk #CustomerService #complaint"
"Always had the best network coverage for me, regardless of where I've been in the south of the country. I enjoy the Dialog rewards in their app - adds a nice touch for customers"
"They talk about 4.5G LTE, But even can't give us stable 4G connection. #dialoglk 4G has 1 or 2 signal bars. Now one of my friend moving with #slt 4G with full signal bars and stable connection."
Worst Telecommunications company 
Simply waste
Thank you
I trust them more than any other mobile network provider.
i have question regarding my connection.   A big one
Comprehensive telco facilities are offered.
Well known mobile network for misuse peoples' money for various 3rd party service without even customers permission. 
the best network provider ever 
I've been using dialog for 10 years ..no problems occurred 
"Thank you for the effort. My router is at the same location as it was before the problem, so I believe its a problem of change of your coverage. However speeds are still very low."
The internet connection is getting worse and worse everyday.
Can you confirm if the Huawei version of My Dialog has all the features and functionalities of Google aplasy Store version..?
Me too but need sth to travel with ne :( unsatisfied
I made a complaint yesterday regarding the poor network services on Twittter and they blamed it on possible incorrect SIM installation. CustomerCare is so bad and top of all so cheap.
So here we go after four weeks of almost no broadband in my home and umpteen complaints chats and a still ongoing issue They have just had the nerve to Bill me for last months broadband It's outrageous the service and supply issues I'm having with this lot
it's been reliable and at the speed we have been promised.
@dialoglk May I know when did I lodge the complaint ID 2-0002723860 and how many times I have contacted customer care and asked to send reminders on that?
No any network challenge to dialog
"Is this really escalated? No one contacted me and I cannot do my work. WTF @dialoglk is doing? No point of blaming the heatwave and if you cannot resolve it immediately, provide a temporary solution like a mobile router, please."
"Also the WhatsApp, Facebook and YouTube packages speed keeps fluctuating.If they control speed they should let customers know so we have a choice of buying those data packs or to use anytime data."
"Hi @dialoglk, can you gimme a fixed solution for this connection slowness issue please? Its been months since I complained about this. ??"
I am using Wifi also it's fast and using shopping by ez cash it's very easy
Problem solved
"Have been a customer of Network Telecom for may years. We have had continued excellent service of both supply and customer service. On the very few occasions we have had a fault, it has been dealt with efficiently and contact made at all stages. Hope this continues in the future. Sales always trying to save us money too. Very refreshing."
Their customer service is excellent. They have always resolved my issues. I think if a person is getting the top package it should include new add on. Their service techs are competent and reliable.
Seems like they respond to WhatsApp messages. Give it a try perhaps
It's all the same! Even at 3am
Most disappointing. Lethargic and not helpful at all.
This is an excellent company love very me rewards got some good gifts from there and going to stay with them and think you should join them.
Yeah. I have seen and experienced the same thing time to time.  But speedtest thing is false.
recommending dialog as your network provider
No issues at all with Dialog
If this comes live from October and Hutch launches 5G for Colombo by October. You might need up packing your bags bcx the company which is backing Hutch can rip you apart
"I was anxious at first to get my iPhone 12 Pro set up. Brian and the other employees were kind, knowledgeable and eager to please. Thank you Dialog Boylston St. for helping, teaching, and assisting me. Highly recommend that store!
"
To solve a simple problem they wasted my money and time for several days.
the day time data is very fast
#youtubedown no no it's actually @dialoglk 's you tube monthly package down.
"Professionalism, expertise and excellent service. "
"I am getting good coverage, fast 5g and reliable network."
Because of that I cannot accept when you say relevant team will get back to me soon. So can you provide a specific time frame please?
"Nearly 10 years with Dialog and never had a problem. I see the ads from all the others then think 'don't fix it if it isn't broken'. I will tell you the same thing, if you are happy with your cell provider stick with them."
I've never had to call back for an update or chase up because something hasn't happened.
So overall getting as good service for half the price. Would recommend.
"Really great to here. But i doubt on some thing is happening coz, i raised this issue on 5th march, no body responded. Ticket was opened for 2 weeks. So you should make sure you provide a wave off from the bill, clearly,"
"Can I have at least 1Mbps?  Shame shame"
"do we have any planned time frame for 2G phase out. Our IoT industry still implemnting new solutions around 2G technologies.

@TechKatha @dialoglk @MobitelSriLanka #SriLanka #IoT #2G"
@dialoglk Oh no guys I'm just complimenting you âù?
Now I'm booking tickets for many events using 444.lk
Dialog TV and internet is amazing. I have been using this internet service for about 9 months now and have not had a bit of trouble. I love it. When they came and hook it all up they explained everything to me and showed me how to use their equipment.
"Very happy with everything that Dialog are providing in terms of their home broadband. The service, speed, cost, set-up, information they send are all first class. Have recommended the service to my friends as I believe it's great value."
 No loss of broadband or reliability issues.
dialoglk says the future today but not using the government introduced QR based covid 19 safety mechanism instead keep people in queues and manually write the names. While this can be a backup tech must be used.
easy to do the online classes without any problem with the connectivity
what is going on with these connection issues? Dialog home broadband is almost unusable now. Even had better connection than this during COVID lockdown last year. What is goin on???? Very disappointed
Very satisfactory service
Good customer management and my request to the relevant service has been fulfilled before the time I expected. Thanks a lot.
Why don't u switch to a fibre connection bro ? Is it because portability?
Why dialog gives more 4G data without providing 4G signal. disappointed.
whats with the data slowness? Mobile and 4G wifi both has been slow down.
I enjoy the rewards that Dialog offer.
